Lots to do here!

- let's fix the lousy cursor, and add a click or mouseover to see the artist + title
- let's add some way to paginate, or otherwise see everything
- let's add URL params to pick a tesselation, image size, number of displayed items, and offset
  - ooh, maybe pick a folder, too!?
- let's also add another tessellation, maybe hexagons, or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombille_tiling
  - let's split each of these out to their own files!

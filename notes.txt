Lots to do here!

- annoynig cursor appears to not be fixed?!
- let's add a click or mouseover to see the artist + title
- let's add a click to paginate
  - I'll need to know how many items to page by, probably part of the tessellation object
- let's add URL params to pick a tesselation, image size, number of displayed items, and offset
  - ah, this also means parameterizing my functions, I should be a dash thoughtful about this
  - ooh, maybe pick a folder, too!?
- let's also add another tessellation, maybe hexagons, or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombille_tiling
  - let's split each of these out to their own files!
